# CF_Excel_GameCo
An end to end analysis in excel for video game company "GameCo". Analysis performed for learning purpose and as a part of Data Analytics Program of CareerFoundry 

GameCo is a new video game company, which wants to use data to inform the development of new games. GameCo has a strong presence globally with strongest market in North America, Europe and Japan.

Here I performed descriptive analysis in Excel of a video game data set to foster a better understanding of how GameCo’s new games might fare in the market 
VGAChartz was the main source of data.The dataset used here contains 16599 observations with sales numbers for each game’s title from 1980-2020, as well as the game’s genre, platform, publisher, and publishing year. 
I started exploring the new dataset with industry standard excel tool - sorted , filtered , created some visualizations and summarized the data with help of pivot tables and 
different functions. That give me an idea about the best sellers, top selling genres and sales performance insights over the period of 40 years. 

Then I explored for dirty data, like incomplete records, duplicate records and removed them using data cleaning technique that helped me to prepare the data for 
further analysis. I also explored some data limitations that may have caused due to the data collection methods used and any potential data bias.  

Further I used descriptive statistic analysis on my clean data set, using measures of Central tendency,distribution, spread, quartiles, data outliers using various 
excel functions and visualizations. I learned to prepare visualizations in form of histograms, box and whisker plots, and scatterplots and they really helped me 
drawing the results and insights.When combined statistics with visualizations, I could clearly see how certain factors in data are skewing the results. 

Based on the data analysis , I have drawn my expectations about , how the sales numbers are going to behave overtime, gave my expectations and proved that my expectations are very close to reality. 

In the final presentation for the management board of GameCo, I showcased my findings and put them in the context of the goal of the analysis. 
The understanding of GameCo was, that sales for the various geographic regions have stayed the same over time. 
By conducting the analysis, I challenged their expectations and recommended changes in the marketing budget for the next year.
